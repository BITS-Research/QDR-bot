Dear %s,

Congratulations on your new NSF Arctic Sciences award %s %s.

The NSF-funded Arctic Data Center support team is passionate about Arctic science. We are here to support researchers like yourself in storing and sharing valuable data.

We are contacting you today because projects funded by the NSF ARC Arctic Social Sciences Program (ASSP) have specific requirements for data and metadata storage. The Arctic Data Center is a long-lived, publicly accessible archive that was created to help researchers meet the NSF data and metadata storage requirements.

At this time, please note that NSF requires all metadata created during your project be submitted to a national data center or another long-lived, publicly accessible archive within two years of collection or before the end of your award, whichever comes first. 

Please note that NSF policies include special exceptions for awards that contain sensitive data, including human subjects data and data that are governed by an Institutional Review Board policy. In those cases, only metadata will be created with only the non-sensitive aspects of the study. More detailed information about what will be expected of you can be found at https://arcticdata.io/submit/#who-must-submit.

With these requirements in mind, we strongly recommend that you plan to keep detailed and well-documented data and metadata records throughout your project. We have some guidelines on organizing your data and best practices on our website: https://arcticdata.io/submit/#organizing-your-data. For those who are interested, we also have regular training opportunities for hands on help posted on this page: https://arcticdata.io/training/.

If your research will involve large data submissions (a total size of > 100 GB or more than 500 files), please get in touch with us so we can create a plan together for those datasets.

We also wanted to highlight the data portals feature at the Arctic Data Center. Portals are dedicated sites that allow individuals and teams to create a collection of related datasets. They facilitate discovery, have collection specific metrics, can include custom search features and can be branded to reflect your organization of collaboration. For more information, examples and tutorials on how to get started visit our data portals page at https://arcticdata.io/data-portals/.

If you have any questions about any of the above, don't hesitate to respond to this email and we will respond as soon as possible.

Good luck on your research!

The Arctic Data Center Support Team
