Dear %s,

  Congratulations on your new NSF Arctic Sciences award %s %s. 
  
  The NSF-funded Arctic Data Center (ADC; https://arcticdata.io/) support team is passionate about Arctic science. We are here to support researchers like yourself in storing and sharing valuable data. 
  
  We are contacting you today because projects funded by the NSF ARC Arctic Social Sciences Program (ASSP) have specific requirements for data and metadata storage. The ADC is a long-lived, publicly accessible archive that was created to help researchers meet the NSF data and metadata storage requirements.
  
  At this time, it is important to note that NSF requires all metadata created during your project be submitted to a national data center or another long-lived, publicly accessible archive within two years of collection or before the end of your award, whichever comes first. More detailed information about what will be expected of you can be found here https://arcticdata.io/submit/#who-must-submit-. 
  
  With these requirements in mind, it is strongly recommended that you plan to keep detailed and well-documented data and metadata records throughout your project. Typically, NSF researchers already do a great job of collecting data and metadata, but you will want to ensure your data and metadata are collected in a manner that can be easily accessed and understood by other researchers after it is published. We recommend you visit our data submission guidelines page (https://arcticdata.io/submit/) to get a better understanding of what is expected for submissions to the ADC.
  
  Please note that NSF policies include special exceptions for ASSP awards and other awards that contain sensitive data, including human subjects data and data that are governed by an Institutional Review Board policy. These special conditions exist for sharing social science data that are ethically or legally sensitive or at risk of decontextualization. In these cases, NSF has requested that a metadata record be created to document non-sensitive aspects of the project and data, including the title, contact information for the data set creators and contacts, and an abstract and methods description summarizing the data collection methodologies that does not include any sensitive information nor data.
  
  If you have any questions about the ADC or NSF requirements, please reply to this email and someone from the ADC will respond as soon as possible. We will also contact you again near the end of your award to help ensure you are meeting NSF requirements.
  
  
  Good luck on your research!

  The ADC Support Team
