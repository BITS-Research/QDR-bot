Dear %s,

  Congratulations on your new NSF Arctic Sciences award %s %s. 
  
  The NSF-funded Arctic Data Center (ADC; https://arcticdata.io/) support team is passionate about Arctic science. We are here to support researchers like yourself in storing and sharing valuable data. 
  
  We are contacting you today because projects funded by the NSF Arctic Sciences Section have specific requirements for data and metadata storage. The ADC is a long-lived, publicly accessible archive that was created to help researchers meet the NSF data and metadata storage requirements.
  
  At this time, it is important to note that NSF requires all metadata created during your project be submitted to a national data center or another long-lived, publicly accessible archive within two years of collection or before the end of your award, whichever comes first. Additionally, data and derived data products are often required to be submitted on that same timeframe (although the timing and submission requirements for data varies between programs). More detailed information about what will be expected can be found here https://arcticdata.io/submit/#who-must-submit-. 
  
  With these requirements in mind, it is strongly recommended that you plan to keep detailed and well-documented data and metadata records throughout your project. Typically, NSF researchers already do a great job of collecting data and metadata, but you will want to ensure your data and metadata are collected in a manner that can be easily accessed and understood by other researchers after it is published. We recommend that you visit our data submission guidelines page (https://arcticdata.io/submit/) to get a better understanding of what is expected for submissions to the ADC.
  
  If you have any questions about the ADC or NSF requirements, please reply to this email and someone from the ADC will respond as soon as possible. We will also contact you again near the end of your award to help ensure you are meeting NSF requirements.
  
  
  Good luck on your research!

  The ADC Support Team
