Dear %s,

The NSF-funded Arctic Data Center support team would like to remind you that there is less than one month until your NSF award %s %s end date.

NSF requires that all metadata created during your project be submitted to a national data center or another long-lived, publicly accessible archive before the end of your award. Additionally, data and derived data products are often required to be submitted on this same timeframe (although the timing and submission requirements for data varies between programs). More detailed information about what will be expected of you can be found at https://arcticdata.io/submit/#who-must-submit.

See the reporting guidelines{https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2016/nsf16055/nsf16055.jsp} from NSF for details, but generally NSF requires that URLs for archived metadata and data should be included in these reports in the section entitled "Products-Websites".

If you have not already done so, please submit your applicable data and metadata by going to our web form: https://arcticdata.io/catalog/submit. You can also visit our data submission guidelines page (https://arcticdata.io/submit/) for more information about the Arctic Data Center submission process.

Prior to issuing a DOI, there is a processing period for the Arctic Data Center to review a submission. While we strive to process data as quickly as possible, larger data sets can take significantly more time to process. It may take a couple days for a small datasets, while a couple weeks for larger datasets. We advise that this is taken to account when planning a submission to the Arctic Data Center for your report.

If you have any questions about the Arctic Data Center, NSF requirements, or need assistance submitting data and/or metadata please reply to this email and we will respond as soon as possible.


Thank you,

The Arctic Data Center Support Team
