Dear %s,

 The NSF-funded Arctic Data Center (https://arcticdata.io/) support team would like to remind you that there is less than one month until your NSF award %s %s expires.
  
  NSF requires that all metadata created during your project be submitted to a national data center or another long-lived, publicly accessible archive before the end of your award. Additionally, data and derived data products are often required to be submitted on this same timeframe (although the timing and submission requirements for data varies between programs). More detailed information about what will be expected of you can be found at https://arcticdata.io/submit/#who-must-submit. 
  
  If you have not already done so, please submit your applicable data and metadata by going to https://arcticdata.io/catalog/#share. You can also visit our data submission guidelines page (https://arcticdata.io/submit/) for more information about the Arctic Data Center submission process.
  
  If you have any questions about the Arctic Data Center, NSF requirements, or need assistance submitting data and/or metadata please reply to this email and someone will respond as soon as possible.
  
  
  Thank you,
  
  The Arctic Data Center Support Team
