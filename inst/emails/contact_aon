Dear %s,

  The NSF-funded Arctic Data Center (https://arcticdata.io/) support team would like to remind you that as part of your NSF Arctic Observing Network (AON) award you are required to submit newly collected data every six months. If you have not already done so please submit any new data to your NSF-approved repository.  
  
  If you have any questions about NSF-AON requirements or the Arctic Data Center, please reply to this email and we will respond as soon as possible.  
  
  Thank you,
  
  The Arctic Data Center Support Team
