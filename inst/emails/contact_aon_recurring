Dear %s,

The NSF-funded Arctic Data Center (https://arcticdata.io/) support team would like to remind you that as part of your NSF Arctic Observing Network (AON) award you are required to submit newly collected data every six months. If you have not already done so please submit any new data to your NSF-approved repository.

Submissions to the Arctic Data Centre can be done here: https://arcticdata.io/catalog/#share. You can also visit our data submission guidelines page (https://arcticdata.io/submit/) for more information about the Arctic Data Center submission process.

Prior to issuing a DOI, there is a processing period for the Arctic Data Centre to review a submission. While we strive to process data as quickly as possible, larger data sets can take significantly more time to process. We advise that this is taken to account when planning a submission to the Arctic Data Center for your report.

If you have any questions about NSF-AON requirements or the Arctic Data Center, please reply to this email and we will respond as soon as possible.

Thank you,

The Arctic Data Center Support Team
