Dear %s,

The NSF-funded Arctic Data Center support team would like to remind you that the deadline to submit your annual report is approaching. 
 
NSF requires that annual reports be submitted at least 90 days before the "anniversary" of your award, and that you must submit applicable data to the Arctic Data Center or another suitable archive and include the DOI or another identifier of the data in your report. See the reporting guidelines{https://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2016/nsf16055/nsf16055.jsp} from NSF for details, but generally NSF requires that URL for archived metadata and data should be included in these reports in the section entitled "Products-Websites".

If you have not already done so, please submit your applicable data and metadata by going to our webform https://arcticdata.io/catalog/submit. You can also visit our data submission guidelines page for more information about the submission process https://arcticdata.io/submit/.

Prior to issuing a DOI, there is a processing period for the Arctic Data Center to review a submission. While we strive to process data as quickly as possible, larger data sets can take significantly more time to process. It may take a couple days for a small datasets, while a couple weeks for larger datasets. We advise that this is taken to account when planning a submission to the Arctic Data Center for your report.

If you have any questions about any of the above, don't hesitate to respond to this email and we will respond as soon as possible.

Thank you,

The Arctic Data Center Support Team
