Dear %s,
  
  My name is %s. I am from the NSF funded Arctic Data Center (https://arcticdata.io/). I am contacting you today to remind you that the deadline to submit your annual report is approaching.  NSF requires that annual reports be submitted at least 90 days before the "anniversary" of your award.
  
  If you have not already done so, please submit your annual report to fastlane.nsf.gov{https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/jsp/homepage/proposals.jsp} 
  
  If you have any questions about this process please respond to this email and someone from the Arctic Data Center will respond ASAP.
  
  Thank you,
  %s
