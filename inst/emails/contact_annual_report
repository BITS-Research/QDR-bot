Dear %s,
   
 The NSF-funded Arctic Data Center (https://arcticdata.io/) support team would like to remind you that the deadline to submit your annual report is approaching. NSF requires that annual reports be submitted at least 90 days before the "anniversary" of your award.
  
  If you have not already done so, please submit your annual report to fastlane.nsf.gov{https://www.fastlane.nsf.gov/jsp/homepage/proposals.jsp} .
  
  If you have any questions about this process please reply to this email and we will respond as soon as possible.
  
  Thank you,
  
  The Arctic Data Center Support Team
